# 🤖 Frobo: The Affordable Emotional Desktop Companion

🚀 Just built a $90 emotional robot that reacts to pets & shakes!

**Frobo** is a budget-friendly emotional AI companion robot built from scratch, inspired by expensive alternatives like Eilik. Frobo is designed to express human-like emotions, respond to tactile interaction, detect table vibrations, and build personality over time — all while being accessible and open-source.

## 💡 Origin of the Idea

The idea for Frobo was sparked by the high market price (~₹20,000 INR) of emotional robots like FASTRON Eilik. I asked myself — *why can't I create a smarter and more affordable version on my own?*  
That challenge turned into **Frobo**, a lovable and customizable robot created for under **₹8,000 INR (~$90)**!
